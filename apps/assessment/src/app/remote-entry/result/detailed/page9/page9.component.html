            Socio Emotional Intelligence measures the individual's mental ability to succeed in any environmental
            circumstance. This assessment framework is leveraged from Bar-On Model of Emotional-Social Intelligence
            (ESI) which was developed by renowned psychologist Reuven Bar-On. As a measurement tool the Bar-On Emotion
            Quotient Inventory (EQ-i) was developed and estimates a person's both emotional and social intelligence.

                <li><strong>Self-awareness:</strong> This dimension involves recognizing and understanding your own
                    emotions, strengths, weaknesses, values, and drivers. It helps you assess how your emotions affect
                    your thoughts and behaviour and enables you to accurately assess your self-worth and confidence.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Self-management:</strong> Self-management is the ability to regulate your emotions,
                    thoughts, and behaviours in different situations. This includes managing stress, controlling
                    impulses, staying motivated, and setting and achieving personal goals. It helps in maintaining
                    emotional balance even in challenging situations.</li>
                <li><strong>Social awareness:</strong> This dimension focuses on the ability to recognize and understand
                    the emotions, needs, and concerns of others. It includes empathy, the capacity to feel what others
                    are feeling, and an awareness of social dynamics, allowing you to understand and relate to people
                    from different backgrounds.</li>
                <li><strong>Social skills:</strong> Social skills involve the ability to communicate, build
                    relationships, and work well with others. This includes effective communication, teamwork, conflict
                    resolution, and the ability to influence and inspire others. Strong social skills help you navigate
                    social situations and build strong, healthy relationships.</li>
