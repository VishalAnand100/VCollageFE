            Adversity quotient (AQ) is a Score that measures a person's ability to deal with challenges in life. It's
            also known as the science of resilience. This test uses four dimensions: Control, Ownership, Reach, and
            Endurance (CORE) to evaluate AQ. <strong> The average ARP Score is 147.5. The higher the better!</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Control:</strong> This dimension measures how much influence you believe you have over a
                    situation or adversity. People with a high sense of control tend to feel empowered to act, even in
                    difficult circumstances. Conversely, those with low control may feel overwhelmed or helpless when
                    faced with challenges.</li>
                <li><strong>Ownership:</strong> Ownership assesses the extent to which people take responsibility for
                    improving or resolving challenges. High ownership means holding themselves accountable for dealing
                    with situations regardless of their cause. It means they actively seek solutions and see yourself as
                    accountable for outcomes. A lower sense of ownership might lead to deflecting accountability,
                    feeling victimized and helpless, and blaming external factors.</li>
                <li><strong>Reach:</strong> Reach evaluates how far you allow adversity to affect other areas of your
                    life. High reach suggests that you can compartmentalize challenges and prevent them from spilling
                    over into unrelated aspects of life. It means they can keep setbacks and challenges in their place,
                    not let them infest the healthy areas of their work and lives. Low reach may result in difficulties
                    in one area impacting overall mood, relationships, or productivity.</li>
                <li><strong>Endurance:</strong> Endurance refers to your perception of how long adversity will last.
                    High endurance is characterized by resilience and optimism, with the belief that challenges are
                    temporary and solvable. Low endurance may involve feeling stuck or believing difficulties will
                    persist indefinitely.</li>
