            Interest & Preferences test results provide an objective basis for engaging in meaningful discussions about
            professional aspirations, values and motivations. This assessment framework is modelled after Hollandâ€™s
            theory which defines personality types as: Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, and
            Conventional (RIASEC).

                <li><strong>Realistic (Doers):</strong> Realistic types generally like to work with things and are often
                    good at mechanical or athletic jobs. They are described as genuine, sensible, practical, natural,
                    thrifty, modest, persistent, and honest.</li>
                <li><strong>Investigative (Thinkers):</strong> Investigative types typically like to work with ideas.
                    They like to watch, learn, analyse and solve problems. They are usually described as logical,
                    curious, exact, intellectual, cautious, independent, quiet, and modest.</li>
                <li><strong>Artistic (Creators):</strong> These people like to work in unstructured situations where
                    they can use their creativity. They are usually described as open, creative, independent, emotional,
                    impulsive, and original.</li>
                <li><strong>Social (Helpers):</strong> These people like to work with other people, rather than things.

                <li><strong>Enterprising (Persuaders):</strong> These people like to work with others and enjoy
                    persuading and performing. They are usually described as outgoing, adventurous, energetic,
                    optimistic, sociable, and self-confident.</li>
                <li><strong>Conventional (Organizers):</strong> These people are very detail-oriented and organized and
                    like to work with data. They are typically described as practical, careful, thrifty, efficient,
                    orderly, and persistent.</li>
